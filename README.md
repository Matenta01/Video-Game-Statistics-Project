## Overview
This project conducts an analysis of video game statistics, exploring trends, identifying the most and least popular gaming platforms, and presenting findings through visualizations. The analysis is conducted using MATLAB.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- MATLAB (R2020a or later recommended)
- MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (if applicable)

## Files in the Project
- **Least_Popular.m**: Script to identify the least popular video games.
- **Most_Popular.m**: Script to identify the most popular video games.
- **Optimised_VideoGames.mat**: Contains optimized video game data.
- **VideoGamesStatistics.m**: Main script for the project.
- **VideoGamesStatisticsP2.m**: Extended analysis script.
- **popular.m**: Processes and analyzes popular video games.
- **unpopular.m**: Processes and analyzes unpopular video games.

## How to Run
1. **Set Up the Project**:
   - Download and extract the project files into a folder on your local machine.
   - Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder containing the project files.

2. **Run the Main Script**:
   - Open `VideoGamesStatistics.m` in MATLAB.
   - Click the "Run" button or type `run('VideoGamesStatistics.m')` in the Command Window.

3. **Explore Additional Analyses**:
   - To analyze the most popular video games, run `Most_Popular.m`.
   - To analyze the least popular video games, run `Least_Popular.m`.

4. **Visualizations and Outputs**:
   - The scripts generate visualizations and statistical outputs to help understand trends in video game popularity.

## Notes
- Make sure the `Optimised_VideoGames.mat` file is in the same directory as the scripts, as it contains the required data for analysis.
- If you encounter any errors, ensure that all dependencies and toolboxes are installed.
